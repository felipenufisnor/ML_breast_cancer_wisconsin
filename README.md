Machine Learning: dealing with data of many dimensions

Data provided by Kaggle.
Well-documented project, where I learned what high dimensional data is; 
I created Machine Learning models for classification;
I built a correlation matrix with Pandas and Seaborn;
I learned how to select features with data visualizations;
I used Scikit-learn to create automatic feature selection templates; 
Finally, I used dimensionality reduction techniques (PCA and T-SNE).
